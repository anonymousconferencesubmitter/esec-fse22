# ESEC/FSE 2022
Artifacts accompanying the paper *"Model vs System Level Testing of Autonomous Driving Systems: A Replication and Extension Study"* submitted for publication at EMSE.

### Replicated paper
This paper compares and extends the paper *"Comparing Offline and Online Testing of Deep Neural Networks: An Autonomous Car Case Study"* by Ul Haq et al., published at ICST 2021. You can find an archival version of the work [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00805).

### RQ0

For RQ0, we were able to download complete output data from [this link](http://tiny.cc/Experiment-data) for the following simulation ids: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32.


### Datasets & Simulator

Driving datasets, self-driving car models, and simulator have a combined size of several GBs and we will make them available upon request. For the submission, we uploaded only a small sample of the data.
